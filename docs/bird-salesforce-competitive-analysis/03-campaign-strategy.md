## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Salesforce Counterattacks with Discounts

**Likelihood:** HIGH
**Impact:** MEDIUM (Price is only 1 of 5 attack vectors)

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize infrastructure ownership (SFMC can't replicate without massive investment)
- WhatsApp native integration (SFMC can't match without acquiring Meta partnership)
- Multi-LLM AI flexibility (Einstein lock-in is architectural, can't easily change)
- Speed to implementation (weeks of consulting can't be eliminated overnight)

**Messaging if SFMC discounts:**
- "Even at 50% discount, SFMC is 80% more expensive than Bird"
- "Discounts don't fix slow implementation, Einstein lock-in, or WhatsApp complexity"

### Risk 2: Legal Claims for Comparative Marketing

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (Could force removal of content)

**Mitigation:**
- Legal review: ALL comparative claims reviewed by legal counsel before publication
- Factual basis: Cite public sources (G2, Gartner, pricing websites, SFMC public docs)
- Disclaimers: "Prices accurate as of [date], subject to change", "Based on publicly available information"
- Avoid: False claims, disparagement, trademark infringement
- Hedge language: "Up to 97% savings" vs "97% savings guaranteed"

### Risk 3: SFMC Improves Product Rapidly

**Likelihood:** LOW (Enterprise vendors move slowly)
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor: Track SFMC product releases, pricing changes, customer feedback
- Adapt: Update messaging if SFMC addresses weaknesses
- Double down: Focus on advantages that are structural (owned infrastructure, 40% global capacity)
- Speed: We can iterate faster as a smaller, nimbler company

### Risk 4: Can't Scale Support for Influx of Customers

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (Churn risk if onboarding fails)

**Mitigation:**
- Hiring plan: Hire CSMs and support engineers in ADVANCE of campaign launch
- Self-service: Heavy investment in docs, video tutorials, knowledge base
- AI-powered support: Use Bird's own AI Employees for tier 1 support (dogfooding)
- Partnerships: Partner with implementation consultancies for white-glove migrations

## Conclusion

This 4-phase campaign strategy positions Bird as the aggressive, cost-effective, feature-rich alternative to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. By targeting SFMC's most vulnerable segments (LATAM mid-market, SMBs, AI-first companies, and enterprise renewals) with tailored messaging for each, Bird can capture significant market share.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Execution Velocity:** Move fast, iterate based on data, don't wait for perfection
2. **Factual Positioning:** All claims backed by data, legal-approved, defensible
3. **Multi-Channel:** No single channel wins - need content, ads, outbound, events, PR, community
4. **Customer Success:** Winning customers is easy, keeping them is hard - invest in CS from day 1

**Expected Outcome:** $569K-$1.49M new ARR in first 12 months with $443K investment (1.3x-3.4x ROI).

**Long-Term Vision:** Become the #1 choice for companies leaving Salesforce Marketing Cloud by 2028.
