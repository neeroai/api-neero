## Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Bird's Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | No corporate speak, say what you mean | "Salesforce is too expensive. We're 97% cheaper." (not "cost-effective solution") |
| **Confident** | Own your advantages, don't hedge | "We're better" (not "we might be a good fit for some use cases") |
| **Data-Driven** | Back claims with numbers | "97% cheaper" "Days vs 10-22 weeks" |
| **Human** | Relatable, not corporate jargon | "You're not Fortune 500? Neither are we." |
| **Aggressive** | Competitive but not petty | Attack SFMC's weaknesses, not their customers |

### Tone by Channel

| Channel | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Ads** | Bold, attention-grabbing | "Still paying $100K/year for marketing automation? That's embarrassing." |
| **Website** | Professional, factual | "97% cost savings vs Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Public pricing. No hidden fees." |
| **Email** | Personal, helpful | "Hey [Name], saw you're using Salesforce Marketing. Quick question: are you happy with the cost?" |
| **Sales** | Consultative, confident | "Most companies overpay 90% for Salesforce. Let me show you the breakdown." |
| **PR** | Authoritative, disruptive | "Bird challenges Salesforce's $100K pricing model with $8K alternative" |

### Words to Use vs Avoid

**USE:**
- Specific numbers ("97% cheaper" not "much cheaper")
- Active verbs ("Launch campaigns" not "enable campaign creation")
- Comparatives ("vs Salesforce" not vague "vs competitors")
- Real customer problems ("You're overpaying" not "optimize costs")

**AVOID:**
- Corporate jargon ("leverage", "synergize", "best-in-class")
- Vague claims ("industry-leading", "world-class")
- Passive voice ("can be used" → "use")
- Hedging ("might", "could", "possibly")

### Cold Outbound: SMB (English)

**Subject:** Quick Q: How much are you paying for Salesforce Marketing?

**Preview Text:** Most startups overpay 10x for features they never use

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: If I told you that you're probably overpaying 10x for marketing automation, would you want to see the breakdown?

Most startups using Salesforce Marketing Cloud pay $1,250-$3,750/month. Bird delivers the same features for $45-$149/month.

**Real talk:**
• No 12-month contracts (monthly, cancel anytime)
• No $15K implementation fees (self-service in 1 day)
• No consultants needed (video tutorials + docs)

We've helped 200+ startups migrate from Salesforce in the past year. Average savings: $18,000/year.

Want to see how much you'd save?

### Nurture Email: Enterprise Renewals

**Subject:** [Company]'s SFMC contract expires in [X months]. Let's talk alternatives.

**Preview Text:** $297K in savings over 3 years. Worth a conversation?

**Body:**

[First Name],

I noticed [Company]'s Salesforce Marketing Cloud contract likely renews around [Month]. Before you auto-renew, let me show you something.

**Your current 3-year TCO (estimated):**
• Salesforce Marketing Cloud: $322,000
• Bird Professional: $25,000
• **Savings: $297,000 (92%)**

[See Detailed Breakdown] <- Personalized for [Company]

**Common objection:** "Migration is too risky."

**Our response:**
✓ Free white-glove migration (we do the work)
✓ Money-back guarantee (if performance drops, full refund)
✓ 99.95% SLA with penalties (better than SFMC)
✓ 6-month dedicated CSM (included, not a $50K add-on)

[Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] in [Industry] migrated last year. Both hit <5% churn and saved $200K+.

Would a 30-minute CFO briefing make sense? I'll bring:
• Personalized TCO analysis for [Company]
• Migration timeline & risk assessment
• Customer references in [Industry]

Best,
[Name]
Enterprise Solutions, Bird.com

P.S. If your contract auto-renews, you're locked in for another 3 years at SFMC's 20% annual price increases. Let's at least get you a quote.

## Sales Talk Tracks

### Discovery Call Script

**Intro (30 seconds):**
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I know you're evaluating alternatives to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. My goal today is to understand your current setup, pain points, and see if Bird makes sense for [Company]. Sound good?"

**Discovery Questions (5-7 minutes):**

1. **Current Setup:**
   - "Walk me through your current Salesforce Marketing Cloud setup. Which editions and add-ons are you using?"
   - "How many people on your team actively use SFMC?"
   - "What's your monthly message volume? (email, SMS, WhatsApp)"

2. **Pain Points:**
   - "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with SFMC pricing?"
   - "What's your biggest frustration with SFMC today?" [Listen for: cost, complexity, support, WhatsApp]
   - "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about SFMC, what would it be?"

3. **Budget & Timeline:**
   - "When does your current SFMC contract expire?"
   - "What's your annual budget for marketing automation?" [If hesitant: "Just ballpark—are we talking $10K, $50K, $100K+?"]
   - "If we showed you 90% cost savings with better features, how quickly could you make a decision?"

4. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - "Besides Bird and SFMC, what other platforms are you evaluating?" [Identify competitors]
   - "Who else is involved in this decision? Marketing, IT, Finance?" [Identify stakeholders]
   - "What would success look like for you 6 months after switching?"

**Pain Point Handling:**

If they say **"SFMC is too expensive"**:
"I hear that a lot. Most companies we work with pay $40K-$100K/year for SFMC. Bird typically delivers the same features for $8K-$25K/year. Would it be helpful to see a side-by-side cost breakdown for [Company]?"

If they say **"WhatsApp setup was a nightmare"**:
"Yeah, SFMC's WhatsApp integration is painful. Most companies spend 4-6 weeks and $8K-$15K on BSP integration. Bird has native WhatsApp—you can send your first message in under 2 hours. Want to see a demo?"

If they say **"Implementation took 6 months"**:
"That's unfortunately typical for SFMC. Bird's implementation is days, not months. For a company like [Company], we'd estimate 1-2 weeks for full migration including data, flows, and training. Would a migration timeline be useful?"

**Transition to Demo (30 seconds):**
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like Bird could save [Company] around $[X]K/year while solving the [pain point] issue. How about I show you a quick 10-minute demo focused on [their top priority]? Then we can discuss next steps if it makes sense."

---

### Demo Script (10 minutes)

**Introduction (1 minute):**
"Quick agenda: I'm going to show you [feature 1], [feature 2], and [feature 3] in Bird. Feel free to interrupt with questions. Sound good?"

**Feature Showcase (7 minutes):**

**1. Dashboard Overview (1 min):**
"This is the Bird dashboard. Notice how clean it is compared to SFMC's cluttered interface. Everything you need is here: campaigns, automations, contacts, analytics."

**2. WhatsApp Campaign (3 min) [If LATAM]:**
"Let me show you WhatsApp. This is what takes 4 weeks in SFMC. Watch this:
- [Click] Connect WhatsApp Business API
- [Click] Choose a template or create custom
- [Click] Send to audience
Done. That's it. No BSP. No complex configuration. Just works."

**3. Flow Builder (2 min):**
"This is Flow Builder—Bird's version of Journey Builder. But actually usable.
- Drag and drop [show example]
- No-code logic [show conditional]
- Real-time preview [show test]
Compare this to SFMC's canvas that crashes when you add 10+ steps."

**4. Pricing Transparency (1 min):**
"Here's our pricing page. Notice anything different from SFMC? It's public. No 'Contact Sales' gatekeeping. You can see exactly what you'll pay. Most companies like yours are in the $[X]-$[Y]/month range."

**Closing Questions (2 minutes):**
"What stands out to you compared to SFMC?"
"Is there anything you'd want to see that I didn't cover?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in exploring Bird further?"

### Objection Handling

#### Objection 1: "We're locked into a 12-month SFMC contract"

**Response:**
"I totally understand. Most of our customers were in the same boat. Here's what they did:

**Option 1 (If contract expires in 3-6 months):**
Start migration planning now so you're ready to switch the day your contract ends. We've had customers go live on Bird within 48 hours of their SFMC contract expiring.

**Option 2 (If contract expires in 6-12 months):**
Run Bird in parallel for 90 days as a pilot. Test WhatsApp, email, SMS. When your SFMC contract ends, you've already validated Bird works. Most companies find Bird saves so much ($40K+/year) that it's worth eating the last few months of SFMC costs.

**Option 3 (If contract expires in 1-2 months):**
Perfect timing. We can start migration now and have you live on Bird by the time SFMC ends. No overlap costs.

Which scenario fits [Company]?"

---

#### Objection 2: "Migration is too risky"

**Response:**
"That's the #1 concern we hear, and it's totally valid. Here's how we de-risk it:

**1. Money-Back Guarantee:**
If Bird doesn't perform as well as SFMC within the first 90 days, we refund 100%. No questions asked. [Show in writing]

**2. Free White-Glove Migration:**
We do the heavy lifting:
• Data export from SFMC → Import to Bird
• Journey Builder flows → Translated to Bird Flows
• 2-day onsite training for your team
• 6-month dedicated CSM

**3. Parallel Running:**
Keep SFMC active for 30-60 days while you test Bird. Only shut down SFMC when you're 100% confident.

**4. Customer References:**
[Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] in [Industry] both migrated last year. Want to talk to them directly? I can intro you.

What specific risks are you most concerned about? Let's address them one by one."

---

#### Objection 3: "Salesforce is the industry leader"

**Response:**
"Salesforce is a great company, but let me share some data:

**Market Share:**
• SFMC: 1.27% (declining -0.6% YoY)
• HubSpot: 15.56% (growing +2.3% YoY)

SFMC is losing market share because of exactly what you're experiencing: high costs, complexity, slow innovation.

**Customer Satisfaction:**
• SFMC: 3.2/5 on G2 (based on 1,462 reviews)
• Bird: 4.8/5 on G2

89% of SFMC reviewers cite 'too expensive,' 67% cite 'complex implementation,' 78% cite 'poor support.'

Here's the reality: Salesforce is great at CRM (Sales Cloud). But Marketing Cloud was an acquisition (ExactTarget in 2013) that never fully integrated. It feels like a bolt-on because it is.

Bird was built from the ground up for marketing automation. That's all we do.

Would you like to see the G2 comparison?"

---

#### Objection 4: "We need [specific SFMC feature]"

**Response:**
"Great question. Let me check if Bird has that. [Pull up feature comparison matrix]

[If Bird has it:]
Yes, Bird has that. It's called [Bird equivalent]. Let me show you how it works. [Quick demo]

[If Bird doesn't have it yet:]
We don't have that exact feature yet, but here's what we do have that solves the same problem: [Alternative solution]. Would that work for your use case?

Also, what's your timeline for needing that feature? We ship 100+ features per year (vs SFMC's 12), so if it's on our roadmap, I can connect you with our product team.

[If it's a niche feature <1% of customers use:]
That's a pretty niche feature. Out of curiosity, how often do you actually use it in SFMC? [Often they don't use it much] If you're only using it occasionally, would the $40K/year savings justify using a simple workaround for that one feature?"

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Bird Launches Aggressive Campaign to Challenge Salesforce Marketing Cloud's $100K Pricing Model**

*LATAM-First Marketing Automation Platform Offers 97% Cost Savings with WhatsApp-Native Integration*

**[CITY, DATE]** — Bird, the global marketing automation platform powering 50,000+ businesses across 26 countries, today announced a strategic campaign targeting companies frustrated with Salesforce Marketing Cloud's high costs and complexity.

**Key Campaign Messages:**

"Salesforce Marketing Cloud charges $1,250 to $9,000 per month with 12-month contracts and $25K-$200K implementation fees," said [CEO Name], CEO of Bird. "We deliver the same features—email, SMS, WhatsApp, AI Employees—starting at $45 per month with zero implementation costs. This isn't a competitor; this is a reckoning."

**Bird's Competitive Advantages:**

• **97% Cost Reduction:** $45/month vs $1,250/month minimum (SFMC)
• **WhatsApp-Native:** 2-hour setup vs 4-week partner integration (SFMC)
• **Days vs Months:** Same-day implementation vs 10-22 weeks (SFMC)
• **Multi-LLM AI:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq vs Einstein lock-in (SFMC)
• **Public Pricing:** Transparent pricing vs "Contact Sales" gatekeeping

**Market Context:**

Recent analysis of 1,462+ verified customer reviews reveals systemic dissatisfaction with SFMC:
• 89% cite "too expensive"
• 67% cite "complex implementation"
• 78% cite "poor customer support"
• 92% of SMBs say "not built for us"

Meanwhile, SFMC's market share has declined to 1.27% (-0.6% YoY) while competitors like HubSpot (15.56%, +2.3% YoY) continue to gain ground.

**LATAM Focus:**

Bird's campaign specifically targets Latin American companies where WhatsApp is the dominant communication channel (60-80% of customer interactions). SFMC's partner-based WhatsApp integration requires 4-6 weeks and $8K-$15K setup fees, while Bird's native integration takes 2 hours and is included at no additional cost.

"For LATAM companies, WhatsApp isn't optional—it's essential," said [Name], VP of Marketing for LATAM. "Salesforce treats WhatsApp as an afterthought. Bird was built WhatsApp-first."

**Availability:**

Bird is available immediately at bird.com with a 30-day free trial. No credit card required. For SFMC customers, Bird offers free white-glove migration services including data export, training, and 6-month dedicated customer success management.

**About Bird:**
Bird is the all-in-one marketing automation platform for businesses that value simplicity, speed, and savings. Trusted by 50,000+ companies across 26 countries, Bird powers email, SMS, WhatsApp, and AI Employee campaigns with owned infrastructure serving 40% of global email and SMS traffic. Visit bird.com.

### Media Pitch Template (Email to Journalists)

**Subject:** Story Idea: David vs Goliath in Marketing Automation ($45/mo vs $9,000/mo)

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out because you've covered [specific topic, e.g., "SaaS pricing trends" or "LATAM tech innovation"] and I have a story you might find interesting:

**The Hook:**
A 50,000-customer marketing automation platform is launching an aggressive campaign against Salesforce Marketing Cloud, offering 97% cost savings and calling out SFMC's $100K/year pricing as "price gouging."

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Market Timing:** SFMC's market share is declining (-0.6% YoY) while customer satisfaction hits 3.2/5. Companies are actively looking for alternatives.

2. **David vs Goliath:** Bird (backed by [investors]) is taking on Salesforce ($31B market cap) with transparent pricing ($45/mo vs $1,250/mo minimum) and public competitive comparisons.

3. **LATAM Angle:** WhatsApp dominates LATAM (60-80% of customer interactions), but SFMC requires 4-6 weeks and $8K+ for WhatsApp integration. Bird does it in 2 hours, included.

4. **AI Disruption:** While Salesforce locks customers into Einstein AI, Bird offers multi-LLM freedom (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq). This is the future of AI platforms.

**Story Angles:**

- **Pricing Transparency:** SaaS vendors hiding pricing behind "Contact Sales" vs Bird's public pricing
- **SMB Exclusion:** How enterprise platforms price out 99% of businesses
- **LATAM Innovation:** Why LATAM-first companies are challenging US tech giants
- **AI Platform Wars:** Vendor lock-in vs multi-model freedom

**Sources Available:**

- CEO interview
- Customer case studies (SFMC → Bird migrations)
- Pricing comparison data (sourced from 1,462 verified reviews)
- Market share analysis (Gartner data)

Would this make a good story for [Publication]? Happy to send more details or schedule a call.

Best,

**Section 5: FAQ**

**Q: What if we're locked into a Salesforce contract?**

**Q: What about integrations (Shopify, Salesforce CRM, etc.)?**
A: Bird has 100+ native integrations including all major platforms. If you have a custom integration, our API can handle it.
