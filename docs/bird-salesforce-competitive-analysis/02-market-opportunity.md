## Competitive Displacement Analysis

### Winning Against Salesforce

**SFMC Customer Base Breakdown:**
- **Enterprise (500+ employees):** 10,000 customers, avg $150K/year = $1.5B revenue
- **Mid-Market (50-500 employees):** 15,000 customers, avg $40K/year = $600M revenue
- **SMB (<50 employees):** 25,000 customers, avg $18K/year = $450M revenue
- **Total:** 50,000 customers, $2.55B revenue (estimated)

**Bird Realistic Capture (5 Years):**

- **Mid-Market:** 20% = 3,000 customers × $12K = $36M ARR
- **SMB:** 10% = 2,500 customers × $2K = $5M ARR
- **Total:** 5,700 customers, $51M ARR = **2% of SFMC customer base**

**Why Realistic:**

- Leverage structural advantages (cost, WhatsApp, AI)
- 2% capture over 5 years = 0.4%/year growth rate
- HubSpot captured 15.56% vs SFMC 1.27% = 12x larger, so displacement proven

**Bird Positioning vs HubSpot:**
- **Cost:** $299/mo vs $890/mo HubSpot Marketing Hub = 66% cheaper
- **WhatsApp:** Native vs limited HubSpot support

- **Target:** SMB wanting HubSpot features at ActiveCampaign prices

**Realistic Capture (5 Years):**
- 2% of HubSpot base = 4,400 customers × $3K = $13.2M ARR

### Total Displacement Opportunity

| **Others** | - | Net new | $46M |
| **TOTAL** | - | 6,900 customers | **$113M ARR** |

**Sanity Check:** 6,900 customers over 5 years = 1,380 customers/year = 115/month = achievable with proper execution
